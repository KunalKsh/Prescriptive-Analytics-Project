# Prescriptive-Analytics-Project
This project uses Excel Solver to optimize profit by assigning dealers to insurance branches. It's a MILP that calculates the best match based on a profit matrix and constraints, including branch capacity and business-rule feasibility. The goal is to maximize total profit from all assignments.
